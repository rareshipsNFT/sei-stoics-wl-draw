Sei Stoics WL Draw
==================

We got 50 WL for the Sei Stoics.  We're going to draw them in a random order.

I collected some entropy in the channel and used it to seed a random number generator.

Then I just draw 50 random addresses from the list of the current holders on zkSync era.

The list of holders in in alphabetical order, so I couldnt just sneak in a few of my own addresses at the right spots.

Hope its fair and everybody is happy :)

## Reproducibility

Call `cargo run` to run the program.  It will print the list of winners to stdout.
